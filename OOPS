Hello to the world of Object Oriented Programming!!

Basics:
1. Objects
Everything is an object which occupies memory because it can be accessed,updated,deleted and created to assign some memory in the heap.

2. Class
It is a template of :
    what properties my objects will have.(datatypes)
    what they will be able to do.(functions)
    can be designed to suit tthe nature of requirement of the use case of the problem.

For example:
    Create multiple records of students containing their names, marks in one subject and roll numbers.

    Normal intuition:
    create multiple string records of name for each student.
    create multiple float records of marks.
    create multiple integer records of roll number for each student.

    Now think:
    if you need to change any record for any student.
    Take sam as your tenth record with marks 35 and roll 30.
    Task : update marks to 40.
    You would have to traverse 10 indexes in marks array to access Sam's marks and then update it.

    Now what their is a new student to be inserted.You would have to shift positions in every array for it to adjust the new corresponding entries.

    THIS IS A CHAOS!!! With just three attributes.

    This is where the concept of Object Oriented Programming comes in!!.


OOPS -- Object Oriented Programming

Create a student class with three instance varialbles - name, marks and rollno.

Keep on creating as many objects of type student using an array data structure of type class.
Problem Solved...

Class Student provided you template with your required values and you just have to keep on using them by creating objects of type student.

Student         student  =       new                 Student();
(class       (reference      (new allocates memory  default constructor
 name)       to the object    during runtime)
            memory address)                       
      
======compile time======     =========run time===================


Constructor:
You created an object student of type Class---fine.
Now your object will look like this in memory

student{
    name = null;
    marks = 0.0;
    rollno = 0;
}

Because no values have been assigned to them.

Constructor will do the work of assigning the values to your objects instance variables.

Now constructor will do the work as follows

Student(String var,float var,int var)
{
    this.name = var;
    this.marks = var;
    this.rollno = var;
}
